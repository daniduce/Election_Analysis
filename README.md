## Election-Audit Summary

In summary, Diane DeGette won the overall vote for all three counties. For future elections, this script can be modified in order to encompass more than three counties, such as an entire state election or even a presidential election. Another modification would be to break the script down not by candidate but by certain bills being passed and votes on said bills.
